##### Design Lint cut Gojek's work by 60%, and boosted issue-spotting by 26%, saving 4,259 hours and $93,709 annually. It's a big efficiency and cost win.

## Background
To enhance the Asphalt design system foundation, we aim to establish a robust structure that offers flexibility for color variations, reduces costs and time when adding new colors, supports festive events, and ensures resilience. This will create a single source of color bank for the product, web, and illustration & creative teams.

---

## Problem identified

- **Limited Creative Flexibility:** Restrictive token colors make it hard for designers to create unique color schemes. For example, GoFood's Ramadan campaign faced delays due to these limits, impacting campaign success and brand differentiation.
- **Inconsistent Brand Experience:** A lack of unified colors across mobile, web, and illustrations leads to a disconnected and inconsistent look, weakening brand recognition and customer trust.
- **High Costs and Delays in Adding Colors:** Without a base set of colors, adding new token colors is costly and time-consuming. Each addition requires multiple themes, causing inefficiencies and slowing down the design process.
- **Non-Scalable Use of Hex Values:** Many products use direct hex values instead of tokens, which limits scalability, hinders mode and theming support, and poses future maintenance challenges


---
## Why do we need it?

#### Benefits to Business

- **Stronger Brand Recognition:** A consistent color system makes Gojek more recognizable, building customer trust and loyalty.
- **Reduced Costs and Faster Delivery:** Standardizing colors cuts down design time and costs, speeding up project delivery.
- **Higher ROI on Design:** With an efficient color process, design resources go further, boosting return on investment across marketing and design efforts.

#### Benefits to Designers

- Establishing a set of these token colors will create a **centralized Gojek color bank and picker for teams across product, mobile, web, illustration, and creative.** This will streamline the process of exploring and adding new colors, reduce time and costs, and enhance brand awareness.

## Hypothesis
>If we establish a universal color bank for the team, then we will have a consistent source of color truth that accelerates exploration, reduces the costs of experimenting with new colors, and enhances brand consistency and awareness for Gojek.

We believe that consistency across Gojek products is one of the keys to providing a great user experience. We can't ignore that the problem and development process is fast and as we all know, it's almost impractical for our designers to manually check every UI aspect of their designs every time. But, Gojek has a holly mantra to solve every problem with “Pasti Ada Jalan” or There is always a way.

Traditional design tools provide a vast range of colors, often with millions of shades, making color selection subjective and prone to accessibility issues. To solve this, we propose a curated, tokenized library of “primitive colors” created using the OKLCH color model. This approach offers an accessible, standardized palette that simplifies shade selection and enhances design consistency across all Gojek platforms.

### What is OKLCH color model

OKLCH is a color model based on the OKLab color space and represents colors with a focus on perceptual uniformity. It uses three parameters:
![Untitled](/oklch/oklch.png)
![Untitled](/oklch/oklch-code.png)

- **L (luminance):** how light or dark a color is, with L=0 being black and L=1 being white.
- **C (chroma):** color intensity.
- **H (hue):** color type.

Example: oklch(0.8 0.15 145deg) for light green.


### Why is OKLCH color model

OKLCH enhances design by expanding the color gamut, simplifying brightness and saturation adjustments, and ensuring smooth gradients. It improves accessibility with easy contrast adjustments, high-contrast palettes, future-proof designs for modern displays, and sufficient contrast for low-vision users.

### Constraint of OKLCH color model
The OKLCH color model is primarily suited for web and desktop applications, with limited support in Android, iOS, and Figma. To address this, we are using the OKLCH color model as a method to establish a color palette by building an OKLCH generator that supports palettes with shades, charts, and accessibility data (WCAG and APCA). However, we will use hexadecimal values in Figma.
