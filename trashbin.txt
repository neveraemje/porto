ChatGPT
The issue you're encountering might be related to the way Markdown is processed in Next.js. Markdown is usually transformed into HTML by default, and the resulting HTML might not always match your expectations, especially when dealing with custom React components.

In your case, it looks like the Markdown processor is treating the HTML within the --- as a block of raw HTML and not processing it as JSX. To resolve this, you can use the dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute in React to render the HTML as-is. Here's an example of how you can modify your JSX:

jsx
Copy code
import React from 'react';

const YourComponent = () => {
  const mdxContent = `

  const htmlContent = mdxContent.split('---')[2].trim();

  return (

  );
};

export default YourComponent;
Note that using dangerouslySetInnerHTML should be done with caution, as it can expose your application to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if not used carefully. Ensure that the HTML content you're rendering is safe from user input or sanitize it appropriately if necessary.

please make it component and import to my mdx with content layer
ChatGPT
Certainly! You can create a React component for the content you provided and then import that component into your MDX file. Here's an example:

Create a new file, for example, ImpactComponent.js:

jsx
Copy code
// ImpactComponent.js
import React from 'react';

const ImpactComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p className="mb-0 font-medium text-lg dark:text-zinc-300">Impact</p>

      <h3 className="bg-gradient-to-br from-pink-500 to-indigo-500 dark:from-pink-500 dark:to-indigo-500 bg-clip-text text-transparent text-3xl lg:text-4xl mb-0">
        Design Lint cut Gojek's work by 60%, and boosted issue-spotting by 26%, saving 4,259 hours and $93,709 annually. It's a big efficiency and cost win.
      </h3>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ImpactComponent;
Now, you can import this component into your MDX file:

jsx
Copy code
// YourMDXFile.mdx
---

import ImpactComponent from './path-to-your-component/ImpactComponent';

<ImpactComponent />
Make sure to replace './path-to-your-component/ImpactComponent' with the correct path to your ImpactComponent.js file.

This way, you keep your MDX file clean and organized, and you can reuse the ImpactComponent in other parts of your application if needed.

how to make this Design Lint cut Gojek's work by 60%, and boosted issue-spotting by 26%, saving 4,259 hours and $93,709 annually. It's a big efficiency and cost win. dinamis
ChatGPT
If you want to make the content dynamic, you can pass the values as props to your ImpactComponent. Here's an updated example:

jsx
Copy code
// ImpactComponent.js
import React from 'react';

const ImpactComponent = ({ cutWork, boostedIssueSpotting, savingHours, savingAmount }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p className="mb-0 font-medium text-lg dark:text-zinc-300">Impact</p>

      <h3 className="bg-gradient-to-br from-pink-500 to-indigo-500 dark:from-pink-500 dark:to-indigo-500 bg-clip-text text-transparent text-3xl lg:text-4xl mb-0">
        Design Lint cut Gojek's work by {cutWork}%, and boosted issue-spotting by {boostedIssueSpotting}%, saving {savingHours} hours and ${savingAmount} annually. It's a big efficiency and cost win.
      </h3>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ImpactComponent;
Now, when you import and use ImpactComponent in your MDX file, you can pass dynamic values as props:

jsx
Copy code
// YourMDXFile.mdx
---

<ImpactComponent
  cutWork={60}
  boostedIssueSpotting={26}
  savingHours={4259}

/>
In this example, the values are hardcoded, but in a real-world scenario, you might fetch these values from an API, a database, or any other data source that suits your application.

User
No I mean make the H3 content is dynamic
ChatGPT
I see, if you want to make the content of the <h3> dynamic, you can pass a dynamic string as a prop. Here's how you can modify the ImpactComponent:

jsx
Copy code
// ImpactComponent.js
import React from 'react';

const ImpactComponent = ({ impactText }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p className="mb-0 font-medium text-lg dark:text-zinc-300">Impact</p>

      <h3 className="bg-gradient-to-br from-pink-500 to-indigo-500 dark:from-pink-500 dark:to-indigo-500 bg-clip-text text-transparent text-3xl lg:text-4xl mb-0">
        {impactText}
      </h3>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ImpactComponent;
Now, in your MDX file, you can pass the dynamic text as a prop:

jsx
Copy code
// YourMDXFile.mdx
---
title: Asphalt Design Lint - Design tool for Figma plugin

import ImpactComponent from './path-to-your-component/ImpactComponent';

<ImpactComponent impactText={impactText} />
By doing this, you can customize the content of the <h3> dynamically by changing the value of the impactText prop in your MDX file.

User
Binding element 'impactText' implicitly has an 'any' type.ts(7031)
(parameter) impactText: any

I use tsx
ChatGPT
Certainly! To handle TypeScript, you should define the type of your props. Let's adjust the ImpactComponent file:

tsx
Copy code
// ImpactComponent.tsx
import React from 'react';

interface ImpactComponentProps {
  impactText: string;
}

const ImpactComponent: React.FC<ImpactComponentProps> = ({ impactText }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p className="mb-0 font-medium text-lg dark:text-zinc-300">Impact</p>

      <h3 className="bg-gradient-to-br from-pink-500 to-indigo-500 dark:from-pink-500 dark:to-indigo-500 bg-clip-text text-transparent text-3xl lg:text-4xl mb-0">
        {impactText}
      </h3>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ImpactComponent;
Now, in your MDX file, when you import and use ImpactComponent, TypeScript will enforce that you pass a prop of type string:

tsx
Copy code
// YourMDXFile.mdx

---

import ImpactComponent from './path-to-your-component/ImpactComponent';

<ImpactComponent impactText={impactText} />
This way, TypeScript will expect impactText to be a string, and you won't encounter implicit any type errors.

here how to make the impacttext from impact
ChatGPT
If you want to extract the impact text from your frontmatter and pass it to your Impact component, you can do something like this:

Assuming you have a file structure like this:

plaintext
Copy code
/src
  /components
    Impact.tsx
  /pages
    YourMDXFile.mdx
Here is how you can structure your files:

tsx
Copy code
// Impact.tsx
import React from 'react';

interface ImpactProps {
  impactText: string;
}

const Impact: React.FC<ImpactProps> = ({ impactText }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p className="mb-0 font-medium text-lg dark:text-zinc-300">Impact</p>

      <h3 className="bg-gradient-to-br from-pink-500 to-indigo-500 dark:from-pink-500 dark:to-indigo-500 bg-clip-text text-transparent text-3xl lg:text-4xl mb-0">
        {impactText}
      </h3>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Impact;
And in your MDX file:

tsx
Copy code
// YourMDXFile.mdx
---

import Impact from "@/components/Impact";

<Impact impactText={impact} />
In this example, impact is directly accessed from the frontmatter of the MDX file. Make sure your MDX setup allows for accessing frontmatter properties like this. The Impact component receives the impactText prop, and you're able to pass the dynamic content to it.

User
can we make the impact text straight foward?
for ex
<Impact>text</Impact>

how?
ChatGPT
Certainly! If you want to directly include the impact text within the <Impact> component in your MDX file, you can do so by utilizing the children prop. Here's how you can modify your Impact component and MDX file:
