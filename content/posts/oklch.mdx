## Background
To enhance the Asphalt design system foundation, we aim to establish a robust structure that offers flexibility for color variations, reduces costs and time when adding new colors, supports festive events, and ensures resilience. This will create a single source of color bank for the product, webX, illustration and creative teams.

---

## Problem identified

- **Limited creative flexibility:** Restrictive token colors hinder unique designs, delaying campaigns like GoFood's Ramadan, and affecting success and brand differentiation.
- **Inconsistent brand experience:** A lack of unified colors across mobile products, WebX, creatives, and illustrations creates inconsistency, weakening brand recognition and trust.
- **High costs for new colors** Without a base color set, adding new tokens is time-consuming and inefficient, requiring updates across multiple themes.
- **Non-Scalable use of Hexa values:** Using direct hex values instead of tokens limits scalability, complicates theming, and creates maintenance challenges.


---
## Why do we need it?

#### Benefits to Business

- **Stronger brand recognition:** A consistent color system makes Gojek more recognizable, building customer trust and loyalty.
- **Reduced costs and faster delivery:** Standardizing colors cuts down design time and costs, speeding up project delivery.
- **Higher ROI on design:** With an efficient color process, design resources go further, boosting return on investment across marketing and design efforts.

#### Benefits to Designers & Engineers

- Establishing a set of these token colors will create a **centralized Gojek color bank and picker for teams across product, mobile, webX, illustration, and creative.** This will streamline the process of exploring and adding new colors, reduce time and costs, and enhance brand awareness.
- A unified reference to eliminate the use of raw hexadecimal values in code.

## Hypothesis

###### "If we establish a universal color bank, then we ensure consistency, speed up exploration, reduce costs, and enhance Gojek's brand awareness."

Consistency across Gojek products is key to delivering a great user experience. While we acknowledge the fast-paced nature of problem-solving and development, Gojek's guiding mantra, *"Pasti Ada Jalan"* ("There is always a way"), drives us to overcome every challenge.

## Propose solution
###### “A universal color bank for Gojek”
Traditional design tools offer millions of colors, which can lead to subjective choices and accessibility challenges. To address this, we propose creating a universal, robust color repository for Gojek based on **the OKLCH color model**. This tokenized color library will offer a standardized, accessible palette, ensuring consistency and improving the user experience across Gojek platforms.

### What is OKLCH color model

OKLCH is a color model based on the OKLab color space and represents colors with a focus on perceptual uniformity. It uses three parameters:
![Untitled](/oklch/oklch.png)
![Untitled](/oklch/oklch-code.png)

- **L (luminance):** how light or dark a color is, with L=0 being black and L=1 being white.
- **C (chroma):** color intensity.
- **H (hue):** color type.

Example: **oklch(0.8 0.15 145deg)** for light green.

---
### Why is OKLCH color model

OKLCH enhances design by expanding the color gamut, simplifying brightness and saturation adjustments, and ensuring smooth gradients. It improves accessibility with easy contrast adjustments, high-contrast palettes, future-proof designs for modern displays, and sufficient contrast for low-vision users.

### Constraint of OKLCH color model
The OKLCH color model is primarily suited for web and desktop applications, with limited support in Android, iOS, and Figma. To address this, we are using the OKLCH color model as a method to establish a color palette by building an OKLCH generator dashboard that supports palettes with shades, charts, and accessibility data (WCAG and APCA). However, we will use hexadecimal values in Figma.
