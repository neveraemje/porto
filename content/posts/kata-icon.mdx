## Discovery process
#### Audit existing icon

The initial phase involves auditing and gathering existing icons, followed by a detailed deconstruction of each icon to extract its metaphorical essence. Subsequently, identify representative characters to craft enduring and impactful symbols.

## Define process

#### Create Principle

The Aksaracons principle refers to the [Kata.ai](http://kata.ai/) logogram, which has three-point fundamentals on this shape. First, the logo has a rounded on each corner shape. Second, there is a law of closure, a gestalt principle. The law of closure states that individuals perceive objects as being whole when they are not complete. Third, the logogram is bold.

#### Bold

The icons use solid type to create strong imagery and refer to our brand's logogram.

#### Intuitive

The icons should use simple metaphors to make them easy to understand.

#### Seamless

Use rounded on every corner and make the icon calm when seen.

## Defining Fundamental

#### Base Grid

A base grid is defined to make icons consistent and pixel-perfect. Regular icons are designed on a 20px grid and exported at 24px artboards.

To make simple metaphors, the icons use basic foundational shapes. It's essential to use simple metaphors but has multi-interpretation allowing other designers to use the icons for different purposes.

#### Key Feature

Aksaracons are designed with solid types. In addition, some icons are designed with outline styles for universal needs, such as arrows, chevrons, checks, etc.

The stroke size is 2px. We are using a round cap at the end to make seamlessness sense and add a touch of delight. Suppose combining the two objects, adding a 2px counter space, gives the closure principle's lasting impression and approach.

Visuals are usually the most effective way to capture the audience's attention and build brand recognition. Consistent visuals make a brand recognizable. Therefore, it's essential to make sure the design works. The question is how to make it work. The simple answer is the design is usable for everyone in the company. Aksaracons has some versioning to achieve that.

<div className=" flex items-center gap-8">
<img src="/icon/Frame_123.png" className=" w-[300px]" />
<p>In 2020, the product design team collaborated with the marketing team and started a rebranding exercise, exploring a fresh take on making a significant impact as an artificial intelligence company. A new logo is a refinement as a fundamental change. Previously, Aksaracons were only part of the Aksara Design Language System. When rebranding, the Aksaracons level up becomes part of the company brand. The challenge is making Aksaracons can be usable by everyone in the company according to their needs. What followed Aksaraconsâ€™ upgrading to the v1.2 version, which has 485 icons with 16 categories.</p>
